# move_quadcopter

This experimental package uses actionlib to implement a simple navigation server and client for [hector quadrotor](http://wiki.ros.org/hector_quadrotor).

## Navigation server
Server publishes `/cmd_vel` topic to control quadcopter movement and `/goal_marker` topic to indicate current goal in RVIZ (for debugging purposes).
The goal is set by navigation client.

## Navigation client
Client subscribes to the `/get_goal` topic. New waypoint for a quadcopter to fly to can be specified for example by:

```
rostopic pub -1 /get_goal geometry_msgs/Point "x: -4.0
y: -4.0
z: 1.0"
```

This will trigger `goalCallback` function of the client which sends a `move_quadcopter::NavigateGoal` request to the server together with XYZ coordinates of the waypoint.

### HOWTO

1. install `move_quadcopter` package in your catkin workspace and compile it (`catkin_make --pkg move_quadcopter`) 
2. launch the test launchfile: `roslaunch move_quadcopter indoor_test_hector_quadcopter.launch`
3. take off (either by publishing to messages to `/cmd_vel` topic or by using joystick - see the comment in `indoor_test_hector_quadcopter.launch`)
4. publish `geometry_msgs/Point` on `/get_goal` topic

The quadcopter should start to move towards the goal marker (visible as small green sphere in RVIZ). It should first adjust its altitude then rotate to face the target and start to moving towards it.

### Remarks
- navigation action is considered successfull by the server if the distance from the goal is less than 0.1 (see `NavigationServer::executeNavigate`)
